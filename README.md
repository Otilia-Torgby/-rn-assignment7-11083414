### Sixth React Native Project

## Here's a brief overview of the project
### Project Description:
#### This is a simple React Native project that displays a home screen and a cart screen and a product detail screen. The home screen displays a list of products in the shop and the cart screen displays a list of products in the cart. The user can add products to the cart by clicking on the "Add to Cart button" and can view what is in the cart by clicking on "Go to Cart". Also, the user can remove items from the cart using the remove item button. The product details screen displays descriptions of the products concerned. The project fetches the products from an external API.

## The components of the project includes:

#### View: is a container element.

#### Text: a component used to display text.

#### Scrollview: a view component used for scrolling.

#### TextInput: a component used for inputing text into the app via a keyboard.

#### Stylesheet: a component used for styling elements.

#### Button: creates a button.

#### Image: Displays images.

#### FlatList: rendering flatlists(a single dimension of data).

#### Navigation: navigate between screens(stack navigator)



### Navigation:

#### React Navigation: I chose react-navigation for navigating between screens because it is a well-supported and widely-used library in the React Native community. 

#### Drawer Navigator: I opted for a drawer navigator to provide a side menu for easy navigation between the Home screen, Product Detail screen, and Cart screen.

### State Management:

#### React Context API: For managing the cart state and ensuring the state is accessible across different screens, I used the Context API. 

### Data Fetching:

#### Axios: I used axios for fetching data from the external API because it provides a promise-based HTTP client with a clean syntax and additional features over the native fetch API.

#### Async/Await: For handling asynchronous operations, I used async/await syntax to keep the code readable and maintainable.

### Local Storage:

#### AsyncStorage: I chose AsyncStorage for persisting the cart data locally on the device.
